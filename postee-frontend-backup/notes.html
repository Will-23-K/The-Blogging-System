🛠️ Postee Blog Detailed Roadmap
Phase 1 – Core Blog (MVP)

👉 Goal: A basic blog where users can register, log in, and manage their own posts.

User Accounts (Auth System)

Add signup (username, email, password).

Add login/logout (session or JWT).

Store user info in DB (Supabase, Firebase, or simple backend DB).

Passwords must be hashed (never plain text).

Post CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Logged-in users can create a new post (title, content, date).

Posts are saved to DB and show up instantly on homepage.

Users can edit/delete only their posts.

Anonymous users can only read posts.

✅ Result: Blog works for multiple users, not just one hardcoded feed.

Phase 2 – Profiles & Personalization

👉 Goal: Give each user an identity and let them customize it.

Profile Page

Each user gets /profile/:username.

Shows their posts + bio + picture.

Editable Bio + Profile Pic

In profile settings, users can edit bio text.

Allow upload of profile picture (store in DB or cloud storage).

Show this info under each post (e.g., “Written by Alex | Bio: Web dev enthusiast”).

✅ Result: Blog feels personal — not just anonymous posts.

Phase 3 – Dashboard (Admin & User)

👉 Goal: Separate normal users vs admin, and give both a control panel.

User Dashboard

Displays user’s posts + stats (number of posts, comments, likes).

Quick buttons: “New Post,” “Edit Profile,” “Delete Post.”

Admin Dashboard

Only accessible to admin role (set in DB).

View all posts + all users.

Ability to delete spammy posts or ban users.

Add a small analytics section: most popular posts, top users.

✅ Result: Blog becomes manageable and scalable.

Phase 4 – UI & UX Polish

👉 Goal: Make it visually clean, responsive, and smooth.

Responsive Navigation Bar

On mobile: icons only (🏠, 👤, 📊, 📜).

On tablet/desktop: icons + text labels.

Active link highlighting.

Post Layout Wrapping

Make sure posts grid/list is responsive.

Long titles or images don’t break layout.

Add pagination or infinite scroll.

Dark Mode Toggle

Use Tailwind dark mode.

Save user preference in local storage.

Animations & Micro-Interactions

Smooth page transitions (Framer Motion).

Hover effects on buttons, cards.

Loading spinners/skeleton screens.

✅ Result: Feels like a polished, professional product.

Phase 5 – Extra Features (Wow Factor)

👉 Goal: Go beyond “just a blog” and impress users.

Pinned Posts

Admin can “pin” posts to homepage.

Pinned posts show at top with a badge.

Search + Filters

Search posts by title, tags, or author.

Filters: “Newest,” “Most Liked,” “By Tag.”

Likes & Comments

Users can like posts (one like per user).

Comment section under posts.

Show comment count on post card.

Notifications System

Notify users when:

Someone comments on their post.

New post is pinned.

Can start with simple alerts on dashboard.

✅ Result: Feels like a social blogging platform, not just a blog.

Phase 6 – Deploy & Lock It In

👉 Goal: Make it public-ready and reliable.

Database Integration

Connect to Supabase, Firebase, or PostgreSQL.

Make sure all user data & posts are stored persistently.

Backend Hosting

If using Node/Express: deploy on Render or Railway.

If using Supabase/Firebase: backend is already managed.

Frontend Hosting

Keep using Netlify.

Ensure environment variables (API keys, DB URLs) are secured.

Testing With Real Users

Ask a friend to sign up, edit their bio, and post something.

Fix bugs they find (UI errors, slow loading, login issues).

✅ Result: A live, feature-rich, and Google-intern-level blog project.

⚡ Big Picture:
If you just push through Phases 1–3, you’ll already have a solid full-stack project.
Phases 4–5 turn it into a portfolio showstopper.
Phase 6 makes it real-world ready.
